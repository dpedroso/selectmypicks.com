	<h4>Tom Brady, New England Patriots</h4>
	<p style="text-align: left;">New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady isn't too worried that the team drafted quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. Brady is obviously one of the safest quarterbacks in the league when it comes to job security, but Garoppolo fits the mold of the kind of quarterback a team would draft, build up with a couple seasons on the bench, and then transition to when the time is right.Regardless, Brady knew this was going to happen, and he's not planning on calling it quits just yet. "I felt like I had a pretty good idea we'd take a quarterback," Brady said. "Coach Belichick doesn't care who the quarterback is here. He's always going to play the guy who he thinks gives him the best chance to win." Right now, and for the foreseeable future, that quarterback is Brady, who also says that he feels "better today than when I was 25." So he's not going to retire anytime soon.</p>
